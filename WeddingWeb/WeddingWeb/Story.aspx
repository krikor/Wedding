        and Alexis at Johnson and Wales University during the future business leaders of 
        America District Competition on March 10<sup>th</sup> 2009. It was lunch time 
        and Alexis had a meal ticket for an hour earlier than Krikor’s. So, Alexis told 
        Krikor that when her lunch time came around she would try to open one of the 20 
        glass doors surrounding the lunch area for Krikor to get in too so they could 
        eat together. Upon examining the glass doors Krikor and Alexis found that they 
        were locked from the outside and had a white piece of paper taped to each door 
        printed with the words “Do not open. Alarm will sound”. Now why would someone 
        put alarms on the cafeteria doors? And 20 of them at that? We simply didn’t 
        believe that each door was rigged. It turns out Johnson and Wales takes their 
        food and their meal time seriously.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:black;mso-themecolor:text1">When 
        Alexis arrived at the dining hall and went to throw away the box of popcorn that 
        she had been snacking on in the trash next to one of the glass door bar, it 
        opened a few inches and the sure enough the alarm started screeching. Every head 
        within earshot looked up at us. On the other side of the door Krikor quickly 
        pushed the door shut and backed away. Alexis turned away from the door looking 
        confused and attempted to innocently walk towards the food line, but the 
        laughter on her face said it all. An hour later, Krikor joined her table for 
        lunch and they burst out laughing together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:black;mso-themecolor:text1">A week 
        later Alexis invited Krikor to one of Audrey’s movie nights. Krikor and Alexis 
        snuggled on the couth talking and watching Hall’s Moving Castle. During one of 
        the intermissions for the popcorn and cookies Alexis asked to see Krikor’s 
        phone. While Krikor went to play foosball, Alexis and Audrey played with his 
        phone. Alexis put her number in his contacts and Audrey took a picture of Alexis 
        for the contact book. Then, they joined Krikor for an epic battle of foosball 
        which Audrey and Alexis definitely won.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        days after the movie night, Alexis texted Krikor to say hello. They texted for a 
        while and Krikor asked Alexis to go to dinner and a movie. Krikor anxiously met 
        her parents, picked her up and took her to Noodles and Co for dinner followed by 
        Watchmen at AMC where Krikor asked Alexis to Prom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
