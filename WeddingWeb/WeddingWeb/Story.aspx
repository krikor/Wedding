    <div class="style22">
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            <strong><span class="style23">K</span></strong>rikor and Alexis met at Johnson and Wales University 
            during the future business leaders of America District Competition on March 10<sup>th</sup>, 
            2009. At lunch time, Alexis had a meal ticket for an hour earlier than Krikor’s. 
            So, Alexis told Krikor that when her lunch time came around she would try to 
            open one of the 20 glass doors surrounding the lunch area for Krikor to come in 
            too, so they could eat together. Upon examining the glass doors Krikor and 
            Alexis found that they were locked from the outside and a white piece of paper 
            with the words, “Do not open. Alarm will sound” was taped to each door. Now why 
            would someone put alarms on the cafeteria doors? And 20 of them at that? We 
            simply didn’t believe that each door was rigged. It turns out Johnson and Wales 
            takes their food and their meal time seriously.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            At the time her meal ticket specified, Alexis entered the dining hall and 
            approached a trash can next to one of the glass doors to throw away the box of 
            popcorn that she had been snacking on. Krikor followed her on the opposite side 
            of door and she smiled at him. Alexis leaned against the door handle as she 
            reached to throw away her popcorn box. The door opened a few inches and then, 
            sure enough, the alarm started screeching. Every head within earshot looked up 
            at us. On the other side of the door Krikor quickly pushed the door shut and 
            backed away. Alexis turned away from the door looking confused and attempted to 
            innocently walk towards the food line, but the laughter on her face said it all. 
            An hour later, Krikor joined her table for lunch and they burst out laughing 
            together.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            A week later, Alexis invited Krikor to one of Audrey’s movie nights. Krikor and 
            Alexis snuggled on the couch talking and watching Hall’s Moving Castle. During 
            one of the intermissions for popcorn and cookies, Alexis asked to see Krikor’s 
            phone. While Krikor went to play foosball, Alexis and Audrey played with his 
            phone. Alexis put her number in his contacts and Audrey took a picture of Alexis 
            for the contact book. Then, they joined Krikor for an epic battle of foosball 
            which Audrey and Alexis definitely won.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            A few days after the movie night, Alexis texted Krikor to say hello. They texted 
            for a while and Krikor asked Alexis to go to dinner and a movie with him. On 
            March 28<sup>th</sup>, Krikor anxiously met her parents, picked Alexis up and 
            took her to Noodles and Company for dinner. After dinner, Krikor and Alexis went 
            to see Watchmen. In the parking lot, before they walked into the movie theater,
            Krikor pulled a dozen roses out of the backseat of the car with a sign “Prom?” 
            attached. Krikor asked Alexis if she would go to prom with him and she said 
            yes.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            Almost four years later, on January 12<sup>th</sup>, Krikor took Alexis out to 
            dinner at P.F. Changs for her 21<sup>st</sup> birthday. After dinner, we went 
            back to his house and Alexis was sitting on Krikor’s bed on his laptop deciding 
            which movie to watch. Krikor asked Alexis if she wanted her present before or 
            after the movie. She said, “Before!” Krikor had hidden her present under his 
            bed, so he knelt on the ground, reached under the bed, pulled out a small box, 
            and opened it to show Alexis a beautiful diamond ring. With a lot of 
            intelligence Alexis asked &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; and Krikor said &quot;It&#39;s a ring!&quot; Alexis 
            was shocked and her brain wasn’t processing the situation, so she just put out 
            both of her hands because she had no idea where he was going to put it! Then, 
            Krikor asked, &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; Alexis was so shocked at the unexpected 
            proposal that all she could ask was a very romantic question, &quot;Are you joking?&quot; 
            Finally, Alexis remembered that Krikor needed an answer and she said yes!<o:p></o:p></p>
